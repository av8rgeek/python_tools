# python_tools
This is a collection of Python (3.x) scripts I wrote over the years.  Some scripts are more well-written than others. Everything here is released using the MIT license.

## Maintenance Status of this repo
These scripts are not currently being maintained.  Cloudflare's "new" module (4.0.0 as of Feb 2025) has breaking changes from previous versions, but these scripts have not been updated to reflect that (or any other module updates).  Use my code at your own risk.

Where files have been updated, I will add a note.
