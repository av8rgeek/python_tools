# python_tools
This is a collection of Python (3.x) scripts I wrote over the years.  Some scripts are more well-written than others. Everything here is released using the MIT license.

## Maintenance Status of this repo
These scripts are not currently being maintained.  Cloudflare's "new" module (4.0.0 as of Feb 2025) has breaking changes from previous versions, but these scripts have not been updated to reflect that (or any other module updates).  Use my code at your own risk.

Where files have been updated, I will try to add a note to those files.

## Environments
My development environment uses VS Code with plugins.  My Python environment uses Pipenv.  For wider compatibility, I also include the requirements.txt.  However, some of these scripts are basic enough that you can just look at the import line and figure it out. ;)
